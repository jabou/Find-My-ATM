# Find My ATM

<b>iOS developer:</b> Abou Aldan Jasmin <br>
<b>Android developer:</b> Loncar Mario <br>
<b>Project was developed as part of:</b> MIPRO International ICT Convention (Junior - Student Papers) with thesis <i>Mobile Application for Finding ATMs</i> <br>
<b>Description:</b>This mobile application gives every iPhone and Android user the ability to quickly find ATMs in Rijeka. 

The app offers you ATM locations for more than 15 banks. It provides the possibility of finding the shortest route and ways to arrive at the desired ATM, as well as advice where it is possible to withdraw cash free of charge.

The idea for this app was born after realising that a lot of people were wasting precious time looking for a place to withdraw money. The app is translated to english so it is appropriate for tourists.
